goodEvent() ::="At Kagu Buzz, we believe an Event It post should be more than three words. Instead, it should contain details and information about the event. That&rsquo;s why there is a minimum requirement of 250 characters for event posts.  You can see how many characters you need with the counter at the left. A good event post will also attract and inform users through pictures, links, and videos, all of which can be added to Kagu Buzz posts."
 
goodAd() ::="At Kagu Buzz, we think an Ad It post should have more than just what the item is; it should have details and information that help paint a picture for the buyer. That&rsquo;s why there is a minimum character count of 150, which must be met to post an event.  You can see how many characters you have left to enter in the character counter. Adding pictures is another way to attract buyers to your ad."

meetingSpot() ::="The Preferred Meeting Spot is the location where you&rsquo;d like to meet to finalize an exchange.  The location can be a coffee shop, cafe, bookstore, or even your home, but we recommended a public location for safety considerations.  The location entered will be revealed only to someone with whom you have agreed to do an exchange. It will not be revealed to other Kagu Buzz users (or anyone else for that matter). You don&rsquo;t have to set a Preferred Meeting Spot if you don&rsquo;t want to--you&rsquo;ll still be able to use the exchange feature."

notifications() ::="In the Notifications section, you&rsquo;ll find all communication from event posts, ad posts, discussions, and messages from Kagu Buzz. The number shown is how many total notifications you have. Notifications will clear automatically when you click on them.  You can also clear notifications by clicking on the \"X\" at the top right of each entry."

adSearch() ::="Add keywords to have Kagu Buzz search for items that contain those words. The number of results will be displayed in a few minutes. You&rsquo;ll also be notified when someone posts a new item that contains those keywords."

eventSearch() ::="Add keywords to search for specific events that contain those words.  The number of results will be displayed in a few minutes.  You&rsquo;ll also be notified when someone posts a new event that contains those keywords."

offerDisclaimer() ::="At Kagu Buzz, we facilitate the exchange, but the final decision and price is up to the parties involved. The offer you make can be considered a starting point. Once both parties meet , there may be requested adjustments for compensation on either side. Also, keep in mind: You can only make an inquiry on a particular item every 10 minutes. We also block \"low ball\" offers,  this helps to prevent the scams and spamming you may experience at other sites."

bookMarks() ::="This section provides a calendar, in chronological order, of your upcoming and past activities. It shows all the information about items in which you&rsquo;re interested. It doesn&rsquo;t show items you&rsquo;re selling--go to \"Manage Your Ads\" under your name in the top right corner for those. Here, you can also see your ratings for events, and feedback for exchanges with others."

verifyPhone() ::="At Kagu Buzz, you have the option of adding your phone number so you can receive text messages regarding the ads you post. You will get text messages whenever a buyer makes an offer, asks a question, etc., on your ad. You will also get text messages when an offer is made on your ad. You can reply to indicate you are accepting, declining, or &ldquo;thinking about&rdquo; the offer, directly from your phone. How cool is that!?"

timeBanking() ::="With a time banking system like Omnui you can reward and thank people who have helped you in a creative and unique way. Instead of offering money to someone who did you a favor you can now thank them in a more friendly way by offering them time credit that they can use now or in the future. You can also offer to help others in your community by posting that you are interested to help people with various tasks in return for Omnui time credit. Visit www.omnui.com for more information."
